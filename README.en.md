When clicking on the button, a frame of**N**pixels wide and**N**pixels high, in which**N**is the number entered in the input. That is, if the value passed to the input is equal to 7, clicking the button will generate a frame of 49 pixels (7 pixels wide x 7 pixels high);


-   The input must have the`id`denominated`board-size`and the button must have the`id`denominated`generate-board`;

-   The input must only accept numbers greater than zero. This restriction**he must**be done using the element attributes`input`;

</details>

## 11 - Limit the minimum and maximum pixel frame size.

<details>
  <summary>A pessoa usu√°ria n√£o pode definir um quadro com menos que 5 e mais que 50 <code>pixels</code></summary>
